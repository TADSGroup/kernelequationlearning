# Equation Learning with kernels

JAX implementation of 

> 'Data-Efficient Kernel Methods for Learning 
Differential Equations and Their Solution Operators: 
Algorithms and Error Analysis' by Jalalian, Osorio, Hsu, Hosseini and Owhadi.



## Conda Environments

Since we run benchmarks using a [PINN-based method](https://github.com/isds-neu/EQDiscovery) that runs on a different version of Python and uses TensorFlow 1.5, we hace separate conda environments for learning differential equations with the different methods.


## Usage 

Under 'final_examples/' there is a folder that contains the code for each PDE explained in the paper.
